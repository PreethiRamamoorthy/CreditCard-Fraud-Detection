# CreditCard-Fraud-Detection

Although digital transactions in India registered a 51% growth in 2018â€“2019, their safety remains a concern. Fraudulent activities have increased severalfold, with approximately 52,304 cases of credit/debit card fraud reported in FY 2019 alone. Owing to this steep increase in banking frauds, it is the need of the hour to detect these fraudulent transactions in time to help consumers and banks that are losing their credit worth each day. Machine learning can play a vital role in detecting fraudulent transactions.


So far, you have learnt about the different types of machine learning models. Now, you will learn which model to choose for your purpose and the reason for it. Understanding models based on different scenarios is an important skill that a data scientist / machine learning engineer should possess. In addition, tuning your model is equally important to get the best fit for your given data.

We are building several machine learning models in algorithms like - Logistics Regression, Random Forest, XGBOOST along with the class imbalance concept of SMOTE, ADASYN, UNIFORM sampling to build models and predicting the transactions as fraudulant or not. Based on the performance metric evaluated for the project, we will recommend best model that classifies the transactions correctly.
